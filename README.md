# CLMS-CIBIL-Module
A Dummy CIBIL (Credit Score) API Module for development and testing in loan management or CRM systems. This module simulates fetching customer credit scores, evaluating eligibility, and risk assessment without connecting to the real CIBIL API. Ideal for testing workflows and frontend integration before real API integration.
